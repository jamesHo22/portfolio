One of my friends experienced seeing a bright light and a deep sense of joy during one of his meditation sessions. He had used this book to guide his meditation. Intrigued by his experience, I began meditating daily.

Through meditation, I've learned:
- That there is no concrete self, but a collection of mental processes each asking for your attention.
- How to have a calm mind in the face of strong emotions.
- Everything we understand is an abstraction of raw sensory information. 

I continue to meditate because I want to think clearly and better understand how my mind behaves.
