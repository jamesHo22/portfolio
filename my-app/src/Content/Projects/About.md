# I am a builder who loves to work on transformative technologies with passionate people in challenging environments.

## An obsessive
I dive deep into problems and find joy in realizing solutions.

## Multidisciplinary
Solving the problem comes first. I will work across teams to get the job done. 

## "Let's try it"

Failing and learning is better than not trying.

## Ok, enough marketing speak
I have always been fascinated by what technology can enable. I remember thinking to myself after watching Iron Man in 2008 that I wanted to solve problems using technology (and obviously become a superhero). With the support of a few great teachers, my peers, and my parents, I began digging into the field of engineering. Fast forward to present day, I am still digging. Now my interests have widened (check out the "Fun" section) and I've learned more about the impact I want my work to have. If you are working on a technology that, if solved, would massively benefit everyone, let's get in touch.
