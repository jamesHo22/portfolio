# I am a builder who loves to work on transformative technologies with passionate people in challenging environments.

## How I got into engineering
I became interested in engineering after watching Iron Man in 2008. Since then, I've been getting myself into as many creative engineering projects as I can find. In elementary school, it was playing with Legos, in middle school it was building remote controlled drones, in high school it was robotics and science fair competitions, and in college it was the electric racecar team.  Once in college, I had the opportunity to work on real problems at various companies spanning different sizes and industries. The experiences I've had and the people I've met continue to inspire me to continue learning.
