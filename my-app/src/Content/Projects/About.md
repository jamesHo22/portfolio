# I am a builder who loves to work on transformative technologies with passionate people in challenging environments.

## An obsessive
I dive deep into problems and find joy in realizing solutions.

## Multidisciplinary
Not everything is an engineering problem.

## "Let's try it"
Failing + learning > ! trying

## Ok, this is getting cringey
I'm just someone who has always found joy in building. As a child, I would spend hours designing lego vending machines, constructing contraptions around the house, and building model planes. The feeling and satisfaction of seeing your ideas materialize is what inspires me to continue learning and building.
