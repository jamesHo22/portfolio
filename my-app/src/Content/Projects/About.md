# I am a builder who loves to work on transformative technologies with passionate people in challenging environments.

## I have deep expertise in hardware development, prototyping, and first principles thinking.
My experience at fast paced hardware startups has taught me how to structure organizations to develop complex hardware quickly. Having designed structural, fluid, and battery systems in the aerospace and automotive industries, I can prototype almost anything. 

## I have breadth of experience in software development and product design.
My experience building YDot, my first software venture, for real users taught me how to identify customer needs through interviews. Iâ€™m able to turn conversations about problems into solutions.

## I have always been fascinated about the futures we can create. 
I remember thinking to myself after watching Iron Man in 2008 that I wanted to solve problems using technology (and obviously become a superhero). With the support of a few great teachers, my peers, and my parents, I began digging into the field of engineering. Fast forward to present day, I am still digging. Now my interests have widened and I've learned more about the impact I want my work to have. If you are working on a problem whose solution could massively benefit humanity, I'd love to chat.
